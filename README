This is a quick experiment with the API for Dropbox
to verify that we can do what we need. Karthik (and I)
will put together a more elegant, higher-level R interface
later.

You will need a new version of ROAuth (>= 0.91-0).

See dropbox.R for examples.  Note that after you
authorize access by the R application to Dropbox, 
just hit Enter (or Return) when prompted for the PIN.
Dropbox doesn't return a PIN and you don't need it.
R and Dropbox will negotiate the authorization after
the access has been granted.
